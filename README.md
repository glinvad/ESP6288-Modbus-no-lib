# Modbus TCP server on NodeMCU0.9
Playing with simple Modbus TCP on a NodeMCU0.9
using PlatformIO in VS-code

The code is the first 10 holding registeres [0-9] or 40001+[0-9]
you can also write to the next and they will be sent to out via the serial monitor

have fun - and remeber, only 1 client can be connected to a modbus server a time.
